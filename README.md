# Neural Networks Lunch & Learn

In this session you will gain an intuituve understanding about how neural networks work.

It is based on this article: [A Neural Network in 11 lines of Python](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/10/neural-network-python-tutorial.html)

I've provided a [python notebook](https://github.com/JackNeto/LL_neural_network_1/blob/master/simple_neural_network.ipynb) 
with extra annotations and charts to help understand the network
